        </p>
        <h2>(L). TERMINATION.</h2>
        <p>
          This Agreement shall continue in effect until termination, and may be
          terminated by Client at any time when Client has no open position(s)
          and no liabilities held by or owed to The Company upon the actual
          receipt by The Company of written notice of termination via e-mail, or
          at any time whatsoever by The Company upon the transmittal of written
          notice of termination to Client; provided, that such termination shall
          not relieve either party of any obligations set out in this Agreement
          nor shall it relieve Client of any obligations arising out of prior
          transactions entered into in connection with this Agreement. We
          reserve the right to suspend your Account at any time (without notice)
          if we believe it is appropriate in the circumstances as per the below:
          Insider trading is the trading of a public company's stock or other
          securities based on material, nonpublic information about the company.
          In various countries, some kinds of trading based on insider
          information is illegal. We do not accept trades under Insider dealing
          and we reserve the right to cancel any trade executed under Insider
          trading. Latency arbitrage (LA) is a high-frequency trading strategy
          used to front-run trading orders. We do not accept Latency arbitrage
          and we reserve our rights to cancel any trade executed under LA.
          Arbitrage is the strategy of taking advantage of price differences in
          different markets for the same asset. For it to take place, there must
          be a situation of at least two equivalent assets or same asset with
          differing prices. In essence, arbitrage is a situation where a trader
          can profit from the imbalance of asset prices in different markets.
          The simplest form of arbitrage is purchasing an asset in the market
          where the price is lower and simultaneously selling the asset in the
          market where the asset’s price is higher. This is widely tradeable
          under market gaps during opening hours. We do not accept gap arbitrage
          and we reserve the right to cancel any trade under those conditions.
        </p>
        <h2>(M). TRADING HOURS</h2>

          The normal trading week begins at 17:15 (5:15 PM EST) on Sunday and

        <h2>(N). CHANGES OF TERMS</h2>

          for reviewing them periodically.
